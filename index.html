            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.Among Web professionals, "Web development"
                usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.</p>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>I'm looking to set some long term goals now. I realised I'm being sidetracked by all the different
                technologies coming out and I really want to settle down and focus on one thing. I believe setting a
                definite goal will help me achieve that. I know goals are personal and unique, but I'm sure I can
                get
                some inspiration from someone.</p>
