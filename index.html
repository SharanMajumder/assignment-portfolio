            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.Among Web professionals, "Web development"
                usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.</p>
