            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.Among Web professionals, "Web development"
                usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.</p>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>I'm looking to set some long term goals now. I realised I'm being sidetracked by all the different
                technologies coming out and I really want to settle down and focus on one thing. I believe setting a
                definite goal will help me achieve that. I know goals are personal and unique, but I'm sure I can
                get
                some inspiration from someone.</p>

            <p>You’re tired of second-guessing if your professional development efforts are meeting the mark. You’re
                ready to build the professional learning your people need in order to be effective with young
                people.Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your
                funders and partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have
                the knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.Without a clear system of high-quality
                training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain. Great staff could leave. Your
                program won’t reach as many young people as it could.</p>

            <p>I got an email from my friend Robin Chan this morning. He's in Beijing and attended a hackathon sponsored
                by our portfolio company 10gen (developer of the open source datastore MongoDB). He said the developers
                in Beijing were showing their love for Mongo and building some great web apps with it.

                your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Cover your mouth and nose with a
                bent
                elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands
                regularly.If
                you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover.
